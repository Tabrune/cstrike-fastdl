Credits/Thanks	: Thanks to Swampbug for the concept of Rats, and to
                : the following play-testers :-
                : [SKR8]Gunslinger for playtesting the CS version.

                : and Harry & the gang @ LSc for testing the original.

------Play Information-----------------------------------------------

Counter-Strike : Bomb/Defusion - 32 starts defined.

The bomb target is a toy UFO sitting on a table top in the kid's bedroom.

2002 Version Notes:

The only significant change in this version is to add 32 player starts
instead of the original 20. The only reason I did this is because of
constant requests for more starts.

Notes:

I made this CS version of Rats3 after many, many requests. I think it's
obvious to anyone that this map is not well-suited to Counter-Strike but
if lots of people want to play it that way for a laugh who am I to say no?

Rats3 has higher r_speeds than official CS maps, and as-such should not
be run in software mode or on older machines.

The buttons and effects on the walkman in the cupboard get screwed-up in
Counter-Strike. As it's only there for decoration I decided to leave it
in as-is rather than take it out altogether.

Incidentally, I implemented the lightswitch in this map after many
requests from people. I've often heard it said that switchable lights
in maps lead to lower framerates but after making this map with and
without this feature I could see absolutely no difference in r_speeds
or framerate between the two versions.

NB: I was the author of all the Rats! maps, but the CS maps de_rats and
cs_rats2a were not released by me. These were conversions made by someone
else from ripped versions of the original maps.
